title = "Feasibility of Artificial Intelligence Driven Analysis in the Context of Nepalese Legal System"
abstract = "We proposed an innovative solution through an Artificial Intelligence driven legal analysis customized to the utility of the Nepalese legal context. Using advanced machine learning (ML) models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the research provides legal insights, streamlines judicial processes, and enhances accessibility to legal information. The legal documents were processed to convert into JSON format, and then to convert into vector data. GPT-4o was used for query expansion and response generation, whereas text embeddings were generated through text-embedding-ada-002. Key features include efficient document retrieval and query expansion for enhanced search precision. The model performs well across different query types, achieving an ùêπ1 score of 0.797 for rule-recall, 0.857 for rhetorical understanding, and 0.875 for interpretation-based queries. This work marks a significant step towards integrating AI into the legal domain of Nepal."
